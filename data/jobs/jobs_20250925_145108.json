Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role:Anthropic is pioneering safe and reliable A I assistants. As we continue to advance industry-leading language models, Claude Code represents a revolutionary approach to agentic coding that enables developers to delegate complex coding tasks directly from their terminal. We're seeking an exceptional documentation engineer with deep Claude Code expertise to lead comprehensive documentation efforts and drive adoption among the global developer community.This role goes far beyond traditional technical writing. You'll be the definitive authority on Claude Code documentation, creating the standards and resources that will shape how developers worldwide integrate AI-powered coding workflows into their daily development practice. You'll work at the intersection of developer tooling, AI application development, and developer education.Responsibilities:• Lead comprehensive documentation strategy for Claude Code• Develop authoritative Claude Code best practices documentation, including context management strategies, tooling setup guides, and workflow optimization techniques• Create extensive Claude Code resources for different development environments, languages, and frameworks, with particular focus on context management and tool integration; this includes the ability to write, debug, and publish clean exemplary code• Design and document Claude Code developer onboarding experiences, from first-time setup to advanced agentic coding patterns• Build comprehensive guides for Claude Code context management, including codebase navigation, file organization, and dependency handling strategies• Develop multimedia technical content specific to Claude Code workflows, including terminal session recordings, context flow diagrams, and integration pattern illustrations• Collaborate with engineering teams to document new Claude Code features, tooling integrations, and capability expansions• Establish metrics and feedback loops to measure Claude Code adoption success and identify workflow friction points• Partner with developer relations teams to create Claude Code content for conferences, blog posts, and community engagement• Contribute to Claude Code toolchain development, including documentation for configuration options, extension capabilities, and integration patternsYou may be a good fit if you:• 5+ years of experience in technical writing and developer education, with demonstrated expertise in developer tooling documentation• Extensive hands-on experience using Claude Code for real software development projects, with deep understanding of context management and workflow optimization• Proven track record of creating content (written, video, or interactive) about AI-powered development tools and best practices• Deep experience building AI applications, particularly using Claude or other LLMs in development workflows• Strong full-stack development skills with proficiency in Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript• Deep understanding of modern software development practices, including version control, CI/CD, testing, and code review processes• Experience with terminal-based development tools and command-line interfaces• Strong understanding of codebase architecture, dependency management, and project organization principles• Excellent technical communication skills with ability to explain complex AI-assisted coding concepts to various developer audiences• Experience conducting developer research and gathering feedback to inform documentation strategy• Demonstrated ability to create comprehensive workflow documentation and developer guidesStrong candidates may also have:• Experience as a power user or early adopter of Claude Code with documented use cases and optimizations• Published content (blog posts, videos, tutorials) demonstrating Claude Code best practices and advanced usage patterns• Background in developer tooling, IDE development, or coding assistant technologies• Experience with AI/ML application development and prompt engineering• Contributions to open-source projects related to AI-powered development tools• Experience with screen recording, terminal session documentation, and interactive tutorial creation• Background in software engineering with experience leading development teams or projects• Knowledge of code analysis tools, static analysis, and automated code review systemsThe expected salary range for this position is:Annual Salary:$280,000 - $405,000 USDLogisticsEducation requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.How we're differentWe believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.Come work with us!Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
